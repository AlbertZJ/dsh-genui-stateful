 *    `[data-streaming]` on the AssistantMarkdown root, which is an ancestor
 *    of every fence. While that marker is present, a plain code block is the
 *    correct rendering (partial JSON must never look like an error).
 *
 * 2. **Settled defect** — the message is finished but the body still does
 *    not parse as JSON (a malformed fence like a missing `}`) or violates the
 *    native chart contract. This used to fail silently: the fence degraded to
 *    a code block with no hint, and the author had no way to know the UI never
 *    rendered. Once the streaming marker is gone, surface a compact diagnostic
 *    so the defect is visible instead of silent.
