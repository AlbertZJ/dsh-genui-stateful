 * dsh-genui browser half: the ```dsh-ui fence renderer, the keyed toolview
 * for the `render_ui` tool, and the session panel dock.
 *
 * Fence rendering uses the stock DSH DOM. `dom-fence.ts` observes the
 * conversation DOM, identifies `dsh-ui` blocks and mounts the renderer in
 * plugin-owned React roots. The plugin-owned GenuiActionContext relays
 * `[genui-action]` through the scoped conversation send.
 *
 * The renderer parses the fence body with the partial parser: while the reply
 * streams, every FINISHED component appears the moment its JSON object
 * closes, so the UI assembles top-down before the fence (or reply) completes.
 * A body with no finished component yet falls back to a plain code block.
