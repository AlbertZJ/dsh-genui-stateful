/**
 * Interaction-state store: durable per-block GenUI interaction state
 * (radio answers, checkbox groups, submit lock, input/textarea values) in
 * localStorage.
 *
 * LOCAL-FIRST persistence: a ```dsh-ui block's interactive state survives
 * page refresh and session reopen because it is keyed by
 * `session + block slot + content fingerprint` — replaying the same message
 * (same content) restores the exact state, while NEW content (换题, edited
 * spec) gets a fresh key and thus a clean slate. Different messages never
 * share state because their content fingerprints differ.
 *
 * Bounded: at most MAX_BLOCKS entries, LRU-evicted on write; each block's
 * payload is small (answer maps + a few field values).
 * @module dsh-genui-stateful/client/interaction-store
